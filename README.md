# Snake game
This is my implementaion of the Snake game.
It is written using Racket programming language.
I used 2htdp/image to create and  handle images.
I used 2htdp/universe as the game engine.
I used lang/posn to position images.
I used rackunit for testing.

After doing the [Programming Languages, Part B](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages-part-b) course and solving multiple problems using the Racket programming language, I thought that it would be good if I did a project using the Racket programming language. So I did the challenge of [Build Your Own Snake Game](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-snake/) using it.
